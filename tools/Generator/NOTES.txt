VkFlags
  category:bitmasks without flags enum are UInt32 now, might be helper translating class (like alias) [TODO]

extensions
  finish extensions binding, generate more platform specific extensions

TODO:
  optional parameters (like AllocationCallbacks) - set default values for method parameters

ideas:

  we might add simplified commands signatures for commands taking
  arrays as parameter(s). to make it more comfortable to pass single
  element to them

  like having for example

     public void ResetFences (Fence[] pFences)
     public void ResetFence (Fence pFence)
